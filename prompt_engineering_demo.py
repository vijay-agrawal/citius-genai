"""# Structuring Prompts

## Few-shot prompting

While system messages could be used to control the behaviour of LLMs, they become quickly unwieldy when we expect the output to follow a specific format (e.g., JSON). In such situations, few examples go a long way in specifying the behavior of the LLM (i.e., *show, rather than tell*). This technique is referred to as few-shot prompting.

Few shot prompt relies on assembling exemplars that specify the output format from the LLM. These exemplars could represent text-to-label tasks or text-to-text tasks.

Remember, that these examples are only for illustration of format; the LLM is in inference mode and does not adapt its internal representation based on these examples.

Let us now implement a few-shot prompt in code. While we will task the LLM to execute sentiment analysis, we will force the model to follow a specific output format. Instead of describing the format in a system message, we will show the format in action as a set of two examples of assistant responses.

"""## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting

Chain-of-Thought prompting is a technique used in generative AI tasks to guide the model's response generation by providing a sequence of related prompts or questions. Instead of a single prompt, a CoT consists of multiple interconnected steps that build upon each other to guide the model's thinking process. These steps represent the "thinking" process that we want the model to follow.

The purpose of CoT prompting is to encourage the model to generate more coherent and contextually relevant responses by guiding its thought process in a structured manner. Each step in the chain serves as a stepping stone, providing additional context or constraints for the model to consider while generating the response.

CoT prompts could also be augmented with few-shot examples, so that the prompt guides the reasoning power of the model while examples guide expected output.
